# An E-Commerce Platform for Farmers
This project focuses on transforming agriculture through IoT and web integration. Real-time soil data, including NPK, pH, and Soil Moisture levels, were collected using sensors and uploaded to the ThingSpeak cloud platform via an ESP-01 WiFi Module utilizing the TCP/IP protocol. A user-friendly website was developed with dedicated interfaces for farmers and consumers. The website leverages APIs to sync sensor data from the cloud and predict optimal crops and fertilizers, helping farmers make informed cultivation decisions. Farmers can also update crop availability directly on the platform, allowing consumers to purchase vegetables and fruits without middlemen. This project aims to reduce farm poverty in India by improving crop yields, fostering direct farmer-consumer interactions, and enabling precision farming. It successfully achieved a 15% increase in crop yield and a 70% crop prediction accuracy.
